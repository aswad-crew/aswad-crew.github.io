# aswad-forever

## foreword

OK here's the rub aswad fans and banned and everyone..

Aswad is a wicked band, and there's no real "definitive database"..
of all record etc, lyrics, who did what...

But what we all enjoy is that "noise" that comes outta le speakers..

And indeed some stuff that comes out the speakers,,
which is what us engineers do.. from tape
and then live with a "real" band...

and some "fans" in the back of the huge speaker stack...
as the lights flash overnight......
and a band member asks.. where are we which tune..
and tony replies.. New Chapter...

So we gonna write a Book..
Called the "chapters of dub" .. is a silly idea...


Of explaining how it worked at the time and space..
eg Tony waking mash up at 2..
drum machine...
and how somehow,, between a few mics, and a tape machine..
u end up with something sonically that is fun, and can eboring and done...
but for someone,, that tune is spcial.. and the emotional "toush"...
makes engineers cry, backing singers emotional, and fans are front singers and not back end right..
Janet was astounded in Japan...
